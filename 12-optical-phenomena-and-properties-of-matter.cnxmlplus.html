<p>Many people are using solar power as a source of energy for their homes. Solar power can be used to heat water or to supply electricity. Have you ever noticed solar panels on homes and buildings? Have you  ever wondered how solar energy is converted to electrical energy? In this chapter, we examine the process that is used to achieve this energy conversion.</p>

<p>Around the turn of the twentieth century, it was observed by a number of physicists 
    (including Hertz, Thomson and Von Lenard) that when light was shone onto a metal plate, 
    electrons were emitted by the metal. This is called the photoelectric effect. 
    (<em>photo</em> for light, 
    <em>electric</em>  for the electron.)</p>

<p>The characteristics of the photoelectric effect were a surprise and a very important
    development in modern physics. To understand why it was a surprise we need to look at the 
    history to understand what physicists were expecting to happen and then understand
    the implications for physics going forward.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title">History and expectations as to the photoelectric effect</h3>
<p>In 1887, Heinrich Hertz (a German physicist) noticed that ultraviolet light incident 
on a metal plate could cause sparks. Metals were known to be good conductors of electricity, 
because the electrons are more able to move. They should be able to
be dislodged if energy were added through the incident light. The problem was that
different metals requred different minimum frequencies of light.</p>

<p>The expectation at the time was that electrons would be emitted for any 
frequency of light, after a delay (for low intensities) during which the 
electrons absorbed sufficient energy to escape from the metal surface. The 
higher the intensity the shorter the delay was be as they would absorb energy faster. This
was based on the idea that light was a wave continuously delivering energy to the 
electrons.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that higher frequency light corresponds to higher 
energy.</p>

<p>The next piece of the puzzle came from Philipp Lenard (a Hungarian physicist) in 1902 when he discovered 
that the maximum velocity with which electrons are ejected by ultraviolet 
light is entirely independent of the intensity of light.</p>

<p>His expectation was that at high intensities the electrons would absorb more energy and so would have a greater velocity.</p>

<p>A <strong>paradox</strong> existed as the expectations and the observations did not match.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein (a German physicist) solved this paradox by proposing 
that light is made up of packets 
of energy called <em>quanta</em> (now called photons) 
which interacted with the electrons in the metal like particles instead of waves. 
Each incident photon would transfer all its energy to one electron in the metal.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>The photoelectric effect</dt><dd>
            
<p>The photoelectric effect is the process whereby an electron 
            is emitted by a substance when light shines on it.</p>

          </dd></dl><p>Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize for his contribution to understanding the
photoelectric effect. His explanation wasn't very popular and took a while to be accepted, 
in fact, some scientists at the time felt that is was a big mistake.</p>

<p>In the motivation letter for Einstein to be accepted into the Prussian Academy of Science
it was specifically mentioned as a mistake:</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title">Implications of Einstein's model</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>For a paper on the history of the photoelectric effect and the analysis of its treatment
in a variety of textbooks see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20389/pdf</p>
</div>
<p>Einstein's model is consistent with the observation that the electrons were 
emitted immediately when light was shone on the metal and that 
 the <em>intensity</em> of the 
 light made <em>no difference</em> to the maximum kinetic energy 
 of the emitted electrons.</p>

<p>The energy needed to knock an
electron out of the substance is called the <strong>work
function</strong> (symbol <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">W_{0}</annotation></semantics></math>) of the substance. This is a characteristic
of the substance. If the energy of the photon is less than the work function then no
electron can be emitted, no matter how many photons strike the substance.
We know that the frequency of light is related to the energy, that
is why there is a minimum frequency of light that can eject electrons. This minimum frequency
we call the cut-off frequency, <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">f_0</annotation></semantics></math>. For a specific colour of light (i.e. a certain frequency or wavelength),
the energy of the photons is given by <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">E=hf=hc/\lambda</annotation></semantics></math>,
where <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">h</annotation></semantics></math> is Planck's constant. This tells us that the  <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">W_{0} = hf_0</annotation></semantics></math>
.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Work function</dt><dd>
    The minimum energy needed to knock an electron out of a metal is called the 
    <strong>work function</strong> (symbol <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">W_{0}</annotation></semantics></math>) 
    of the metal. As it is energy, it measured in joules (J).
    </dd></dl><p>Energy is conserved so if the photon has a higher energy than <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">W_{0}</annotation></semantics></math>
then the excess energy goes into the kinetic energy <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">{E}_{k}</annotation></semantics></math> of the electron 
that was emitted from
the substance.</p>

<p>The excess over and above the binding energy is actually the 
<strong>maximum</strong> kinetic energy the emitted electron can
have. This is because not all electrons are on
  the surface of the substance. For electrons below the surface there is additional energy
    required to eject the electron from the material which then cannot contribute to the
      kinetic energy of the electron.</p>
<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\begin{align*}
        E &amp; = W_{0}+{E}_{k\max} \\
        {E}_{k\max}&amp; = hf-W_{0}  
        \end{align*}</annotation></semantics></math><p>This equation is known as the photoelectric equation.</p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is now clear, the question was "why does increasing the intensity 
intensity of the light not affect the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photons?". The answer
is that each emitted electron has absorbed <strong>one</strong> photon, increasing
the intensity just increases the number of photons (we expect more electrons but we don't expect
their maximum kinetic energy to change).</p>

<p>The discovery and understanding of the photoelectric effect was one of the major breakthroughs in science in the twentieth century as it provided concrete evidence of the particle nature of light. It overturned previously held views that light was composed purely of a continuous transverse wave. On the one hand, the wave nature is a good description of phenomena such as diffraction and interference for light, and on the other hand, the photoelectric effect demonstrates the particle nature of light. This is now known as the 'dual-nature' of light. (dual means two)</p>

<p>Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics for this quantum theory and his explanation of the photoelectric effect.</p>

<p>We can observe this effect in the following practical demonstration of photoelectric 
    emission. A zinc plate is charged negatively and placed onto the cap of an electroscope.  
    In Figure <a href="#fig:red-electroscope" data-class="InternalLink">fig:red-electroscope</a>, red light is shone onto 
    the zinc plate. There is no change observed even if the 
intensity (brightness) of the red light is increased. In Figure <a href="#fig:blue-electroscope" data-class="InternalLink">fig:blue-electroscope</a>, ultraviolet 
light of low intensity is shone onto the zinc and it is observed that the leaf of the 
electroscope collapse. This allows us to conclude that the negative charge on the plate 
decreased as electrons were ejected from the metal when the ultraviolet light was incident 
on the plate.</p>

<p>The work function is different for different elements. The smaller the work function, the easier it is for electrons to be emitted from the metal. Metals with low work functions make good conductors. This is because the electrons are attached less strongly to their surroundings and can move more easily through these materials. This reduces the resistance of the material to the flow of current i.e. it conducts well.

<p>When dealing with calculations at a small scale (like at the level of electrons) it is more convenient to use different units for energy rather than the joule (J). We define a unit called the electron-volt (eV) as the kinetic energy gained by an electron passing through a potential difference of one volt.</p>
<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">E=q\times V</annotation></semantics></math><p>where q is the charge of the electron and V is the potential difference applied. The charge of 1 electron is \(\text{1,6} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\)~\(\text{C}\), so \(\text{1}\)~\(\text{eV}\) is calculated to be:</p>
<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">1&#160;\mathrm{eV}=\left(\text{1,6} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\text{ C} \times \text{1}\text{ V}  \right)=  \text{1,6} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\text{ J}</annotation></semantics></math><p>You can see that \(\text{1,6} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\)~\(\text{J}\) is a very small amount of energy and so using electron-volts (eV) at this level is easier.</p>

<p>Hence, \(\text{1}\)~\(\text{eV}\) = \(\text{1,6} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\)~\(\text{J}\) which means that \(\text{1}\)~\(\text{J}\) = \(\text{6,241} \times \text{10}^{\text{18}}\)~\(\text{eV}\)</p></div><div class="activity" type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Demonstration of the photoelectric effect</h1>
<p>We can set up an experiment similar to the one used originally to study the photoelectric effect. The experiment allows us to measure the number of electrons emitted and the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.</p>
<figure><img src="images/photo_electric_apparatus.png" width="519"/><figcaption class="caption"><p>Photoelectric effect apparatus</p>

          </figcaption></figure><p>In the diagram of the Photoelectric Effect Apparatus, an ammeter allows for a current to be measured. Measuring the current allows us to deduce information about the number of electrons emitted and the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.</p>

<p>In the diagram, notice that the potential difference supplied by the battery is zero and yet a current is still measured on the ammeter. This is due to the incoming photons having sufficient frequency and hence energy greater than the work function to eject electrons. The ejected electrons travel across the evacuated space and allow for a current to be measured in the circuit.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>, photon energy is related to frequency while intensity is related to the number of photons.</p>

<p>The generation of electricity using solar cells isn't due to the photoelectric effect
    but is similar in nature. Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed 
    by semiconducting materials, such as silicon.</p>

<p>Electrons (negatively charged) are knocked 
    loose from their atoms, allowing them to flow through the material to produce electricity. 
    This is called the photovoltaic effect.
    The photovoltaic effect was first observed by French physicist Antoine E. Becquerel in 1839.</p>

<p>You have learnt previously about the structure of an atom. The electrons 
          surrounding the atomic nucleus are arranged in a series of levels of increasing 
          energy. Each element has a unique number of electrons in a unique configuration
           therefore each element has its own distinct set of energy levels. This arrangement 
          of energy levels serves as the atom's unique fingerprint.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, scientists found that a liquid or solid heated to high 
          temperatures would give off a broad range of colours of light. However, a gas 
          heated to similar temperatures would emit light only at certain specific wavelengths 
          (colours). The reason for this observation was not understood at the time.</p>

<p>Scientists studied this effect using a discharge tube.</p>
<figure><img src="images/discharge_tube.eps" width="624"/><figcaption class="caption"><p>Diagram of a discharge tube. The tube is filled with a gas. When a high 
              enough voltage is applied across the tube, the gas ionises and acts like a 
              conductor, allowing a current to flow through the circuit. The current excites 
              the atoms of the ionised gas. When the atoms fall back to their ground state, 
              they emit photons to carry off the excess energy.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><p>A discharge tube (shown in Figure <a href="#dischargetube" data-class="InternalLink">dischargetube</a>) is a 
          gas-filled, glass tube with a metal plate at both ends. If a large enough voltage difference 
          is applied between the two metal plates, the gas atoms inside the tube will absorb 
          enough energy to make some of their electrons come off, i.e. the gas atoms are ionised. 
          These electrons start moving through the gas and create a current, which raises some 
          electrons in other atoms to higher energy levels. Then as the electrons in the atoms 
          fall back down, they emit electromagnetic radiation (light). The amount of light 
          emitted at different wavelengths, called the <strong>emission 
          spectrum</strong>, is shown for a discharge tube filled with hydrogen gas in 
          <a href="#hydrogenspectrum" data-class="InternalLink">hydrogenspectrum</a> below. Only certain wavelengths (i.e. colours) 
          of light are seen, as shown by the lines in the picture.</p>

          of this happening. When an electron in an atom falls from a higher energy 
          level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon to carry off the extra energy. 
          This photon's energy is equal to the energy difference between the two energy

          can still be scattered).</p>

<p>Using this effect, if we have a source of photons of various energies we can 
          obtain the <strong>absorption spectra</strong> for different materials. 
          To get an absorption spectrum, just shine white light on a sample of the material that 
          you are interested in. White light is made up of all the different wavelengths of 
          visible light put together. In the absorption spectrum there will be gaps.
          The gaps correspond to energies (wavelengths) for which there is a corresponding
          difference in energy levels for the particular element.</p>

<p>The absorbed photons show up as black lines because the photons of these wavelengths 
          have been absorbed and do not show up. Because of this, the absorption spectrum is 
          the exact <em>inverse</em> of the emission spectrum. 
          Look at the two figures below. In Figure <a href="#fig:emissionSpec" data-class="InternalLink">fig:emissionSpec</a> you can see 
          the line emission spectrum of hydrogen. Figure <a href="#fig:absorptionSpec" data-class="InternalLink">fig:absorptionSpec</a> shows the 
          absorption spectrum. It is the exact opposite of the emission spectrum! Both emission 
          and absorption techniques can be used to get the same information about 
          the energy levels of an atom.</p>

            </figcaption></figure><p>The dark lines correspond to the frequencies of light that have been
          absorbed by the gas. As the photons of light are absorbed by electrons, the electrons
          move into higher energy levels. This is the opposite process of emission.</p>

<p>The dark lines, absorption lines, correspond to the frequencies of the emission
          spectrum of the same element. The amount of energy absorbed by the electron to move 
          into a higher level is the same as the amount of energy released when returning to the

<div class="worked_example"><h1 class="title">Absorption</h1><div class="question">
              
<p>I have an unknown gas in a glass container. I shine a bright white light 
              through one side of the container and measure the spectrum of transmitted light. 
              I notice that there is a black line 
              (<em>absorption</em> line) in the middle of the 
              visible red band at \(\text{642}\)~\(\text{nm}\). 
              I have a hunch that the gas might be hydrogen. If I am correct, between which 
              2 energy levels does this transition occur? (Hint: look 
              at Figure <a href="#fig:Henergy" data-class="InternalLink">fig:Henergy</a> and the transitions which are in the visible 
              part of the spectrum.)</p>

            </div><div class="workstep"><h2 class="title">What is given and what needs to be done?</h2>

<p>We have an absorption line at \(\text{642}\)~\(\text{nm}\). This means that the substance in the glass container absorbed photons with a wavelength of 642 nm.
We need to calculate which 2 energy levels of hydrogen this transition would correspond to. Therefore we need to know what energy the absorbed photons had.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:Henergy" data-class="InternalLink">fig:Henergy</a> shows various energy level 
                transitions. The transitions related to visible wavelengths are marked as 
                the transitions beginning or ending on Energy Level 2.
                Let us find the energy of those transitions and compare with the energy of 
                the absorbed photons we have just calculated.</p>

<p>Energy of transition (absorption) from Energy Level 2 to Energy Level 3:</p>
<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\begin{align*}
		 \Delta E_{electron} = {E}_{2,3}&amp; = {E}_{2}-{E}_{3}\\

		 &amp; = -\text{3,1} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\text{ J} 
		\end{align*}</annotation></semantics></math><p>Therefore the energy of the photon that an electron must absorb to jump from Energy Level 2 to Energy Level 3 is \(\text{3,1} \times \text{10}^{-\text{19}}\)~\(\text{J}\).
(NOTE: The minus sign means that <em>absorption</em> is occurring.)</p>

<p>This is the same energy as the photons which were absorbed by the gas in the container! Therefore, since the transitions of all elements are unique, we can say that the gas in the container is hydrogen. The transition is absorption of a photon between Energy Level 2 and Energy Level 3.</p>

<p>The study of spectra from stars and galaxies in astronomy is i
          called <em>spectroscopy</em>. Spectroscopy is a 
          tool widely used in astronomy to learn different things about astronomical objects.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="title">Identifying elements in astronomical objects using their spectra</h4>
<p>Measuring the spectrum of light from a star can tell astronomers what the 
            star is made of. Since each element emits or absorbs light only at particular 
            wavelengths, astronomers can identify what elements are in the stars from 
            the lines in their spectra. From studying the spectra of many stars we know 
            that there are many different types of stars which contain different 
            elements and in different amounts.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Determining velocities of galaxies using spectroscopy</h4>
<p>You have already learnt in <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://everythingscience.co.za/grade-12/09-doppler-effect/">Chapter 9</a><a href="#chap:doppler-effect" data-class="InternalLink">chap:doppler-effect</a> about the Doppler 
            effect and how the frequency (and wavelength) of sound waves changes 
            depending on whether the object emitting the sound is moving 
            <em>towards</em> or 
            <em>away</em> from you. The same thing happens 
            to electromagnetic radiation (light). If the object emitting the light is 
            moving <em>towards</em> us, then the wavelength 
            of the light appears shorter (called <strong>blueshifted</strong>). 
            If the object is moving <em>away</em> from us, 
            then the wavelength of its light appears stretched out 
            (called <strong>redshifted</strong>).</p>

<p>The Doppler effect affects the spectra of objects in 
            space depending on their motion relative to us on the earth. For 
            example, the light from a distant galaxy that is moving away from us 
            at some velocity will appear redshifted. This means that the emission 
            and absorption lines in the galaxy's spectrum will be shifted to a longer 
            wavelength (lower frequency). Knowing where each line in the spectrum 
            would normally be if the galaxy was not moving and comparing it to 
            the redshifted position, allows astronomers to precisely measure the velocity 
            of the galaxy relative to the Earth.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Global warming and greenhouse gases</h4>
<p>The sun emits radiation (light) over a range of wavelengths that 
            are mainly in the visible part of the spectrum. Radiation at these 
            wavelengths passes through the gases of the atmosphere to warm the 
            land and the oceans below. The warm earth then radiates this heat 
            at longer infrared wavelengths. Carbon dioxide (one of the main 
            greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere has energy levels that correspond 
            to the infrared wavelengths that allow it to absorb the infrared radiation. 
            It then also emits at infrared wavelengths in all directions. This 
            effect stops a large amount of the infrared radiation from getting out of the 
            atmosphere, which causes the atmosphere and the earth to heat up. More 
            radiation is coming in than is getting back out.</p>

<p>So increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases the amount of trapped infrared radiation and therefore the overall temperature of the earth. The earth is a very sensitive and complicated system upon which life depends and changing the delicate balances of temperature and atmospheric gas content may have disastrous consequences if we are not careful.</p>

<p>Explain how atomic emission spectra arise and how they relate to each element on the periodic table.</p>

              </div><div class="solution">
                  
<p>Atomic emission spectra arise from electrons dropping from higher energy levels to lower energy levels within the atom, photons (light packets) with specific wavelengths are released. The energy levels in an atom are specific/unique to each element on the periodic table therefore the wavelength of light emitted can be used to determine which element the light came from.</p>

<p>How do the lines on the atomic spectrum relate to electron transitions between energy levels?</p>

              </div><div class="solution">
                  
<p>The lines on the atomic spectrum relate to electron transitions between energy levels, if the electron drops an energy level a photon is released resulting in an emission line and if the electron absorbs a photon and rises an energy level an absorption line is observed on the spectrum.</p>

              </div><div class="solution">
                  
<p>The difference between absorption and emission spectra are that absorption lines are where light has been absorbed by the atom thus you see a dip in the spectrum whereas emission spectra have spikes in the spectra due to atoms releasing photons at those wavelengths.</p>
