    <h1>Doppler effect</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Have you noticed how the pitch of a police car or ambulance siren changes as it 
      passes where you are standing. Or how an approaching car or train sounds different 
      to when it is tavelling away from you? If you haven't, try to do an experiment 
      by paying extra careful attention the next time it happens to see if you can notice a difference.
      This doesn't apply to just vehicles and trains but anything that emits waves, be those sound waves
      or light (electromagnetic waves).
    </p>
    
    <p>The effect actually occurs if you move towards or away from the source of the sound as well. 
      This effect is known as the <strong>Doppler effect</strong> and will be studied in this chapter.

      <div class="title">Creating the Doppler effect in class</div>
      <p>You can create the Doppler effect in class. One way of doing this is to get:</p>
      <ul data-class="ListBulleted">
        <li>string, and</li>
        <li>a tuning fork.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tie the string to the base of the tuning fork. Strike the tuning fork to create a note and then hold the other end of the string and swing the tuning fork in circles in the air in a horizontal plane.</p>
      <div class="note" data-type="warning">
        <p>The string needs to be very securely tied to the tuning fork to ensure that it does not come loose during the demonstration.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The class should be able to hear that the frequency heard when the tuning fork is moving is different to the frequency heard when it is stationary.</p>

    <h2>The Doppler effect with sound</h2>
    
    <p>
      You, the person hearing the sounds, are called the <em>observer</em> or <em>listener</em> and the thing emitting the sound is called the <em>source</em>. As mentioned in the introduction, there are two situations which lead to the Doppler effect:
    </p>
    <ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
        
        <p>When the source moves relative to the observer.</p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
        <p>When the observer moves relative to the source.</p>
        
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In fact, both the source and the observer can be moving at the same time but we won't deal with that case in this chapter.</p>
    <dl class="definition">
      <dt>Doppler effect</dt><dd>
        
        <p>The Doppler effect occurs when a source of waves and/or observer move relative to 
          each other, resulting in the observer measuring a different frequency of the waves 
          than the frequency that the source is emitting.
        </p>
        
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The question that probably comes to mind is: <em>"How does the Doppler effect come about?"</em>. We can understand what is happening by thinking through the situation in detail.
    </p>
    <h3>Case 1: Moving source, stationary observer</h3>
    
    <p>Let us consider a source of sound waves with a constant frequency and amplitude. 
      The sound waves can be represented as concentric circles where each circle represents 
      a creast or peak as the wavefronts radiate away from the source. This is because 
      the waves travel away from the source in all directions and the distance between 
      consecutive crests or consecutive troughs in a wave is constant (the wavelength 
      as we learnt in Grade 10). In this figure the crests are represented by by the 
      black lines and the troughs by the orange lines.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="photos/Gr12_Doppler_01.jpg" width="468"/>
      <figcaption class="caption"><p>
          
        </p>
        <p>Stationary sound source as more wavefronts are emmitted.</p>
        
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The sound source is the police car in the middle and is stationary. For 
      the Doppler effect to take place (manifest), the source must be moving 
      <em>relative</em> to the observer. Let's 
      consider the following situation: The source emits one wave (the circle 
      represents the creat of the wave) that moves away from the source at the 
      same rate in all directions. The distance between the crests represents 
      the wavelength of the sound. The closer together the crests, the higher 
      the frequency (or pitch) of the sound according to 
      <math>

      ,
      where

          <mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">v</annotation>

       (speed of sound) is constant.

      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>As this crest moves away, the source also moves and then emits more crests. Now the two circles are not concentric any more, but on the one side they are closer together and on the other side they are further apart. This is shown in the next diagram.</p>
    <div class="alternates">

    <p>If the source continues moving at the same speed in the same
      direction, then the distance between crests on the right of the
      source is constant. The distance between crests on the left is
      also constant. The distance between successive crests on the left is constant
      but larger than the distance between successive crests on the right.

    <p>When a car approaches you, the sound waves that reach you have a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency. You hear a higher sound. When the car moves away from you, the sound waves that reach you have a longer wavelength and lower frequency. You hear a lower sound.</p>

    </p>
    <h3>Case 2: Moving observer, stationary source</h3>
    
    <p>Just as we did before, let us consider a source of sound waves with a constant 
      frequency and amplitude. 
      There are two observers, one on the left 
      that will move away from the source and one on the right that will move towards the source. 
      We have three diagrams. The 
      first diagram describes the overall situation,  the second diagram shows the situation
      some time interval later and the third diagram is after another time interval.
      The wavefronts are numbered so you can see how they 
      move further away and so that we can track which ones an observer has measured.
    </p>
    <img src="photos/Gr12_Doppler_03-A.jpg" width="468"/>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE: Above is a placeholder plot to be improved and higher resolution</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>The observers can hear the waves emitted by the police car and after the first
      time interval they start to move.
    </p>
    <img src="photos/Gr12_Doppler_03-B.jpg" width="468"/>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE: Above is a placeholder plot to be improved and higher resolution</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>It is important to remember that the frequency is the number of points 
      that are in phase (for example crests or troughs) that pass a point 
      (observer) in one second. We can compare the frequency the two observers 
      measure but just counting how many wavefronts (these are all in phase) 
      they measure in the time interval that has passed.
    </p>
    
    <p>In the time interval that passed, the observer moving towards the
      police car observed the crests and troughs numbered 1 through 5 (the portion
      of the wave is highlighted below). The observer moving away encountered a 
      smaller portion of the wavefront but in the same time interval. To the observers
      this will mean that the frequency they measured is different.
    </p>
    <img src="photos/Gr12_Doppler_03.jpg" width="468"/>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE: Above is a placeholder plot to be improved and higher resolution</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>The motion of the observer will alter the frequency of the measured sound from a stationary source:</p>
    <ul data-class="ListBulleted">
      <li>
        An observer moving <strong>towards</strong> the source measures a <strong>higher</strong> frequency.
      </li>
      <li>
        An observer moving <strong>away from</strong> the source measures a <strong>lower</strong> frequency.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to note that we have only looked at the cases where the source and observer are moving directly towards or away from each other and these are the only cases we will consider.</p>
    
    <p/>
    <div class="note" data-type="note">
      <p>We didn't actually need to analyse both cases. We could have used either explanation because of relative motion. The case of a stationary source with moving observer is the same as the case of the stationary observer and the moving source because the relative motion is the same. Do you agree? Discuss with your friends and try to convince yourselves that this is the case. Being able to explain work to each other will help you understand it better. If you don't understand it, you won't be able to explain it convincingly.</p>
      
      <p>For a real conceptual test, discuss what you think will happen if the source and the observer are both moving, in the same direction and at the same speed.</p>

        <p>The question explicitly asks what frequency you will hear when the source is moving at a certain speed. This tells you immediately that the question is related to the Doppler shift. The values given in the question are all in S.I. units so no conversions are required.</p>

        <p>To correctly apply this we need to confirm that it is valid and determine what signs we need to use for the various speeds. The observer is not moving but we have to consider two different cases, when the ambulance is moving towards the observer (a) and away from them (b).
          We have been told that if the source is moving towards the observer then we will use subtraction in the denominator and if it is moving away, addition. This means:

       (the upper limit of human hearing). These waves can be used in medicine to determine the direction of blood flow. The device, called a Doppler flow meter, sends out sound waves. The sound waves can travel through skin and tissue and will be reflected by moving objects in the body (like blood). The reflected waves return to the flow meter where its frequency (received frequency) is compared to the transmitted frequency.
      Because of the Doppler effect, blood that is moving towards the flow meter will change the sound to a higher frequency and blood that is moving away from the flow meter will cause a lower frequency.
    </p>
    
    <p>Ultrasound can be used to determine whether blood is flowing in the right direction in the circulation system of unborn babies, or identify areas in the body where blood flow is restricted due to narrow veins. The use of ultrasound equipment in medicine is called sonography or ultrasonography.</p>

    <h2>The Doppler effect with light</h2>
    
    <p>Light is a wave and earlier you learnt how you can study the properties of one wave 
      and apply the same ideas to another wave. The same applies to sound and light. 
      We know the Doppler effect is relevant in the context of sound waves when the source is 
      moving. Therefore, in the context of light (EM waves), the frequency of observed light
      should be different to the emitted frequency when the source of the light is moving 
      relative to the observer.
    </p>
    
    <p>A frequency shift of light in the visible spectrum 
      could result in a change of colour which could be observable with the naked eye. There will
      still be a frequency shift for wavelengths of EM radiation we cannot see.
    </p>
    
    <p>We can apply all the ideas that we learnt about the Doppler effect to light. 
      When talking about light we use slightly different terminology to describe what 
      happens. If you look at the colour spectrum (more details in Chapter 
      <a href="#chap:electromagnetic-radiation" data-class="InternalLink">chap:electromagnetic-radiation</a>) then you will see that blue 
      light has a shorter wavelength than red light. Since for light, 
      <math>
        <semantics>
          <mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">c=f\lambda</annotation>
        </semantics>
      </math>
      ,shorter wavelength equals higher frequency.
      Relative to the  middle of the 
      visible spectrum (approximately green light) longer wavelengths (or lower frequencies) are redder
      and shorter wavelengths (or higher frequencies) are bluer. So we call shifts towards longer 
      wavelengths "redshifts" and shifts towards shorter wavelengths "blueshifts".

    <p>A shift in wavelength implies that there is also a shift in frequency. Longer wavelengths of light have lower frequencies and shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies. From the Doppler effect we know that when the source moves towards the observer any waves they emit that you measure are shifted to shorter wavelengths (blueshifted). If the source moves away from the observer, the shift is to longer wavelengths (redshifted).</p>
    <h3>The expanding universe</h3>
    
    <p>Stars emit light, which is why we can see them at night. Galaxies are huge 
      collections of stars. An example is our own Galaxy, the Milky Way, of which our sun 
      is only one of the billions of stars!
    </p>
    
    <p>Using large telescopes like the Southern 
      African Large Telescope (SALT) in the Karoo, astronomers can measure the light 
      from distant galaxies. The spectrum of light can tell us what elements are in 
      the stars in the galaxies because each element has unique energy levels and therefore 
      emits or absorbs light at particular 
      wavelengths. These characteristic wavelengths are called spectral lines because
      the show up as discrete frequencies in the spectrum of light from the star.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="caption">
        <p>Asubset of the spectral lines of hydrogen</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If these lines are observed to be shifted 
      from their usual wavelengths to shorter wavelengths, then the light from the 
      galaxy is said to be <em>blueshifted</em>. If the 
      spectral lines are shifted to longer wavelengths, then the light from the galaxy 
      is said to be <em>redshifted</em>.
      If we think of the blueshift and redshift in Doppler effect terms, then a 
      blueshifted galaxy would appear to be moving <em>towards</em> 
      us (the observers) and a redshifted galaxy would appear to be 
      moving <em>away</em> from us.
    </p>
    <div class="note" data-type="tip">
      <p>1. If the light source is moving away from the observer (positive
        velocity) then the observed frequency is lower and the observed
        wavelength is greater (redshifted).
      </p>
      
      <p>2. If the source is moving towards the observer (negative velocity), the observed frequency is higher and the wavelength is shorter (blueshifted).</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Edwin Hubble (20 November 1889 - 28 September 1953) measured the Doppler shift of a large sample of galaxies. He found that the light from distant galaxies is <em>redshifted</em> and he discovered that there is a proportionality relationship between the <em>redshift</em> and the <em>distance</em> to the galaxy. Galaxies that are further away always appear more redshifted than nearby galaxies. Reemember that a redshift in Doppler terms means a velocity of the light source <em>away</em> from the observer. So why do all distant galaxies appear to be moving away from our Galaxy? None of them seem to be moving towards us.

      Some of the galaxies will be moving in our direction but more slowly than the 
      space between us and them is expanding. The expansion is so large that it is 
      the primary effect that we observe. The light isn't actually redshifted because 
      all of the Doppler effect, it is redshifted because the space is expanding, 
      the waves are being stretched out.

    <p>There are two things you can do to help you visualise this a little better. 
      One thing to try is to get a balloon and draw some dots on it with a marker. As 
      you blow the balloon up all the dots get further away from all the other dots. 
      The dots represent galaxies in a two-dimensional, expanding universe (the balloon 
      surface). Another thing to imagine is baking raisin bread. As the bread rises, 
      the distance between all the raisins gets larger. Every raisin thinks that all 
      the other raisins are moving away from it.

    <p>In this picture the bottom vertex represents the beginning of time, the flat surface
      represents space. As you move up through the panels you are moving later in time and the
      expansion of the the flat surface shows the expansion of the universe. The galaxies 
      shown on the surface get further away from each other just because of the expansion
      of space.

            <p>An instrument called a Doppler flow meter can be used to transmit ultrasonic waves into a person's body. The sound waves will be reflected by tissue, bone, blood etc., and measured by the flow meter. If blood flow is being measured in an artery for example, the moving blood cells will reflect the transmitted wave and due to the movement of the cells, the reflected sound waves will be Doppler shifted to higher frequency if the blood is moving towards the flow meter and to lower frequency if the blood is moving away from the flow meter.</p>
